# Session 4: Dictionaries, Exception Handling, and File I/O

## Lesson Objectives

- Learn how to create and manipulate dictionaries in Python
- Understand dictionary methods and compare them to JavaScript object methods
- Introduce exception handling in Python using try...except and compare it to JavaScript's try...catch
- Understand the importance of handling errors and exceptions in code
- Learn basic file input/output operations in Python
- Compare Python's file handling with JavaScript's file handling

## Topics Covered

### Dictionaries in Python

- Creation using curly braces {} with key-value pairs
- Accessing, adding, modifying, and deleting entries
- Dictionary Methods
  - .keys(), .values(), .items(), .get(), .update(), .pop()
- Comparison with JavaScript Objects
  - Similarities in key-value storage
  - Accessing properties using dot notation and bracket notation
  - Iterating over objects/dictionaries

### Exception Handling in Python

- Using try, except, else, and finally
  - Syntax and structure of exception handling
  - Catching specific exceptions vs. general exceptions
  - The flow of control in try blocks
- Raising Exceptions
  - Using the raise keyword to trigger exceptions
- Comparison with JavaScript
  - try...catch blocks in JavaScript
  - Differences in syntax and exception handling mechanisms
- Best Practices
  - Writing robust code that anticipates and handles errors
  - Clean-up actions using finally

### File Input/Output (I/O) in Python

- Opening and Closing Files
  - Using open() function with different modes ('r', 'w', 'a')
  - The importance of closing files to free resources
- Reading from Files
  - Reading entire files with .read()
  - Reading line by line with .readline() and iterating over file objects
- Writing to Files
  - Writing data using .write() and .writelines()
- Using Context Managers
  - Employing the with statement to handle files safely
  - Automatic handling of file closure
- Comparison with JavaScript
  - File handling in JavaScript using Node.js fs module
  - Asynchronous vs. synchronous operations
  - Differences in approach and syntax
